[-]Original Code
Quote:

If $FreeBuilder = 0 Then
SetLog(GetLangText("msgNoBuilders"), $COLOR_RED)
ClickP($TopLeftClient) ; Click Away
Return




replace with :




Version 1 (You can choose to use All Builder even in checked Wall Upgrade Condition, Just checked "AB" first before you checked Wall Upgrade):
Quote:

If $FreeBuilder = 0 Then
SetLog(GetLangText("msgNoBuilders"), $COLOR_RED)
ClickP($TopLeftClient) ; Click Away
Return
ElseIf $FreeBuilder <= 1 And Not (IsChecked($chkUseAllBuilder)) And (IsChecked($chkWalls)) Then
SetLog(GetLangText("msgDontUseAllBuilder3"), $COLOR_RED)
ClickP($TopLeftClient) ; Click Away
Return
ElseIf $FreeBuilder <= 1 And Not (IsChecked($chkUseAllBuilder)) And Not (IsChecked($chkWalls)) Then
SetLog(GetLangText("msgDontUseAllBuilder"), $COLOR_RED)
ClickP($TopLeftClient) ; Click Away
Return
endif




OR





Version 2 (Whatever you do, if Wall Upgrade are checked you can't use All Builder to Autoupgrade) :
Quote:

If $FreeBuilder = 0 Then
SetLog(GetLangText("msgNoBuilders"), $COLOR_RED)
ClickP($TopLeftClient) ; Click Away
Return
ElseIf $FreeBuilder <= 1 And Not (IsChecked($chkUseAllBuilder)) And (IsChecked($chkWalls)) Then
SetLog(GetLangText("msgDontUseAllBuilder3"), $COLOR_RED)
ClickP($TopLeftClient) ; Click Away
Return
ElseIf $FreeBuilder <= 1 And (IsChecked($chkUseAllBuilder)) And (IsChecked($chkWalls)) Then
SetLog(GetLangText("msgDontUseAllBuilder2"), $COLOR_RED)
ClickP($TopLeftClient) ; Click Away
Return
endif
